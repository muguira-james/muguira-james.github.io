Design thinking and how it enables insight

Have you ever been working on a problem and found that you are completely stuck?  You may change tasks for the moment and do something else.  Then, after some time, a thought occurs and you see the solution to your problem.  Its an ’Ah’ moment when the answer jumps into your mind.  Many times it seems the act of moving to a new task or taking a break from the problem allows your mind to sort through everything and gain insight.   There has been a lot of research into insight.  Several theories have been brought forward that focus on this idea of thinking about something else as a stimulant to problem solving.

 This essay will examine design thinking through research into insight.  My purpose is to link design thinking processes to current cognitive research into insight and to show how theories into insight explain design thinking’s success.

The Process

Consider Stanford’s example of how to accomplish design thinking (1). The 5 step Stanford process leads the designer through:

understanding the customer and their problems, by developing empathy,
defining the problem space and framing,
generating ideas,
prototyping those ideas,
testing those ideas for merit.
These steps are preformed in a non-sequential, iterative manner as the designer seeks to first employ expansive thinking to capture ideas and then employ more focused constrictive thinking to drive toward a delightful solution.

Framing 

An early design thinking step is helping the designer frame a problem.  To arrive at this frame or set of definitions about the problem our designer starts with embedding themselves into the problem environment.  They work with the customer, spending the day learning about and doing the work with the customer, discussing the how’s, and why’s of the way the customer sees, feels about, and approaches each task. This first step provides the designer with a deep understanding for the customer and how they feel and understand their environment.  This is in contrast to more traditional methods of problem solving taught in business schools that have the designer understand simply the work process, inputs / outputs, and constraints.  In striving to apply the design thinking paradigm, the designer seeks to dive deeply into the customer’s environment with the goal of finding solutions that enhance the environment, not simply solve the problem.

 Shared Knowledge

These frames help the designer not just define the problem, but to enable discussion around the problem.  Nonaka’s Socialize, Externalize, Communicate, and Internalize (SECI) (2) model helps to understand this process.  The designer is seeking to socialize their internal thoughts and get them out where others can experience them through communication and eventually internalize them.  These frames form a mental representation that allows the designer to search and combine additional knowledge with the frame.  Insight research focuses on the act of generating new mental connections.  Within the design thinking paradigm these new connections can come through discussion with the team.  These discussions will produce additional methods of organizing the problem or problem reframing that enables new thought and new connection processes, further feeding expansive thinking on the part of the design team.  In terms of insight research this reframing also facilitates the types of changes in representation insight researchers find take place before a subject realizes that ‘Ah’ feeling of knowing the solution.

 Expansive Thinking

From an efficiency perspective, the designer does not want to become stuck.  Applying an iterative design thinking paradigm mitigates this impasse.  The first few steps of the design thinking paradigm enable expansive thinking that exposes many ideas for consideration.  Insight researchers find that as the human brain tackles a problem it goes through an extensive round of activity to search through its connections. Research shows that the brain starts out optimistically applying heuristics, searching connections as it is looking for a solution. As the designer judges that the search seems to get nearer to a solution the number and of variety of heuristics declines.  Design thinking purposely delays judging solutions early in the process, instead substituting expansive idea generation and environmental exploration through prototyping.

Changing Representation 

One major reason to apply an iterative design thinking paradigm to problem solving is to avoid becoming stuck and having to invest the mental energy to back up and try a new path.  Insight research shows that changing the representation of problem is a precursor to realizing a solution.  Yet, changing paths is difficult and effort escalates depending on the investment in the current path. Design thinking exposes the design team to many solution ideas, striving to keep an exploratory mind set and avoiding too deep of a focus on a single solution path. This exploratory mind set facilitates examining the problem environment though analogy, and constraint relaxation as prototypes are created to enable understanding to problem variable interaction.

Conclusion 

Problem reframing, environment exploration, adjusting and relaxing constraints are all methods insight research has focused on to explain how the mind can “jump” to a solution.  Design thinking’s iterative, exploratory process of solution realization exposes the designer to many possible solution paths and helps them to keep an open mind as a problem space is explored.  Judgment of solutions is only applied after the team has applied as much expansive thinking as possible and prototypes has been created to explore aspects of the environment. It is these acts of exploration and delay of judgment that align design thinking to how we generate insight.
