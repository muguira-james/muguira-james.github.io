The business architecture describes the value you provide to a customer, your key strengths, the way the customer perceives your value stream, and the cost structure for fielding that stream.</p>\n<p>Some argue that Business Architecture is a part of Enterprise Architecture. I’m not going there. We’ll focus specifically on Business Architecture. Let me be clear: the technical and business architectures HAVE TO ALIGN. It has been my experience that the business architecture has to come first. You have to know what you are doing before you can apply technology to do it.</p>\n<p>Not so many years ago, everybody thought you had to write a business model and plan. This consisted of a 10 or so page paper describing how you were going to make money, who you were going to sell to and how they would find / interact with your product or service. Problem is, few people read that paper.</p>\n<p>Today, we use a series of tools, or maybe templates that describe the business model, product or service, customer pain points and internal understanding / measurement of your organization, These tools lend themselves to rapid refinement. This is a critical aspect! Rapid and continuous refinement is essential to being competitive in the modern work place.</p>\n<p>This article will establish a way of thinking about delivering value to a customer. We frame the value delivery problem in several ways: using experimentation and small commitments of resources to explore a viable path forward; focus on the customer and how to translate their needs into products or services; and characterizing value delivery in terms of products not projects. Each of these ideas will be expanded upon in future articles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-market-place-and-competition\">The Market Place and Competition<a title=\"#the-market-place-and-competition\" href=\"#the-market-place-and-competition\"></a></h2>\n<p>Many would say that the modern market place moves faster today. I think organizations are getting better at exploiting change. Successful organizations have learned to experiment and structure themselves for rapid change. This idea of structuring for rapid change is key and the basis of the rest of this article.</p>\n<p>Successful organizations make lots of little bets, exploring many paths and using a small commitment of resources for each bet. As the potential of a path becomes more clear, more resources are shifted toward that path. Over and over you will see that performing lots of small explorations with small commitments for each provide will optimize your position for future gain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customer-centricity\">Customer Centricity<a title=\"#customer-centricity\" href=\"#customer-centricity\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are three sources of innovative ideas: basic and applied research, supply chain influences and customers. Each has a distinct time line and characteristic resource commitment.</p>\n<p>Research has a very long and risky time horizon. You commit a great amount of resources and time to derive an outcome. Only the best funded organizations follow this path. The time and resource commitment exposes your organization to a great deal of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Listening to and anticipating customer needs has been very fruitful as a source of innovation. But customers don’t always express their needs clearly. It has been my experience that in observing the customer, you look for the pain-points: the weakest, lengthiest, most expensive aspects of their workflow. Buried in these pain-points are the keys to innovative products or services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"portfolio-vs-program\">Portfolio vs Program<a title=\"#portfolio-vs-program\" href=\"#portfolio-vs-program\"></a></h2>\n<p>When the scientific method was applied to business organizations, external influences and forces were removed. The program and composite projects were examined for optimization.  Application of the scientific method created a large knowledge base of ways to improve the operating efficiency of any given organization. But, it caused attention to be drawn inward.</p>\n<p>The scientific method is still valid. But, the focus of optimization needs to incorporate the business environment. You bring value to customers. That is why they buy your product or service. Optimization should take place around the customer value stream, which includes the overall business environment.</p>\n<p>Thinking about the products or services you provide as a “portfolio” acknowledges that overall environment the product or service lives within. Thus, you are optimizing a portfolio. You are striving to improve each aspect of the portfolio as much as you can during each time period.</p>\n<h2 id=\"product-vs-project\">Product vs Project<a title=\"#product-vs-project\" href=\"#product-vs-project\"></a></h2>\n<p>A portfolio is composed of many products or services, each orchestrated to bring a single unit of value to the customer, within that environment. Again, thinking in terms of projects, removes the environmental aspects from your thinking. As we will see when considering the “Business Model Canvas” the environment is a key component of that value stream.</p>\n<p>Thinking of and optimizing in terms of products also orients your thinking toward the customer.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<a title=\"#conclusion\" href=\"#conclusion\"></a></h1>\n<p>Structuring the overall business around an architecture is important. That architecture describes the value of the product or service you bring, how you are uniquely structured to deliver, and how the customer will find you. Business leaders consistently optimize the business. What they may miss is where to focus optimization efforts. Start with the customer. From there organize your products / services around portfolios and optimize within that portfolio. You company builds products or services. Customers do not buy programs or projects.</p>\n","next":{"title":"Using_a_monorepo_with_github","link":"2022/03/29/Using-a-monorepo-with-github"},"plink":"http://muguira-james.github.io/2022/04/17/BusinessArchitecture:-market-optimization-focus/","toc":[{"id":"introduction---customer-centricity","title":"Introduction - Customer Centricity","index":"1","children":[{"id":"the-market-place-and-competition","title":"The Market Place and Competition","index":"1.1"},{"id":"customer-centricity","title":"Customer Centricity","index":"1.2"},{"id":"portfolio-vs-program","title":"Portfolio vs Program","index":"1.3"},{"id":"product-vs-project","title":"Product vs Project","index":"1.4"}]},{"id":"conclusion","title":"Conclusion","index":"2"}],"reading_time":"864 words in 6 min"}
